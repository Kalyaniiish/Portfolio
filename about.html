<body>
    <p>I am a BCA student with a strong interest in web development and programming. I'm currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and basic backend technologies to build responsive and user-friendly websites.

        I’ve worked on a few beginner-level projects and continuously practice through online courses and coding platforms. I’m looking for internship opportunities where I can learn from real-world experience, contribute to exciting projects, and grow my skills as a future full stack developer.
        
        I am eager to learn, open to feedback, and always ready to take on new challenges.</p>
